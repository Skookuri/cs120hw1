<p>I wanted to take this class because I thought that taking a grad level equivalent of CS 20 would be helpful in refreshing my web programming skills. I am part of the JumboCode web dev team and enjoy programming websites as a hobby. I am also planning to TA for CS20 this upcoming fall.</p>

<p>My Favorite Restaurant: 
	<a href="https://tworooms.jp/en/">Two Rooms Bar and Grill</a>
    <p>I enjoy Two Rooms because of the beautiful view and the moody atmosphere of the restaurant. The food is high quality and tasty, with the best bread rolls before the main meal.</p>

<p class="food">This is the kuroyanagi onsen manjuu. The region I live in in Japan, Izu, Shizuoka, has a lot of onsens (hot springs) and onsen tourism, and alongside these onsens people can enjoy the delicious traditional Japanese sweets called manjuus. The kuroyanagi onsen manjuu is often consumed as a treat, or used as offerings for Buddhist shrines inside our houses.</p>
